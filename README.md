# Hackathon-Chatbot: Al Bot with Voice Assistant 
This is a multilingual AI ChatBot which has four different personalities.  Created with the help of Python and Python libraries.

Description of Problem: 
Develop an Al bot with a Voice assistant that listens to end-user questions/queries and replies back with a proper response (S2S) system. The challenge here would be that the end user can speak in any language and the bot should be able to respond in the same language. The Al bot should have a character and a back story (For example, A rude banker who hesitates to answer the query to the customer or a soft and humble actor who loves to respond to his fans) and should stick to it. The bot should answer only related to its backstory and character.
